Webcam app for Windows

I wrote this in around the year 2001. Some people still find it useful. The
original home is [on Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/p/fwink/code/),
but is now [on Github](https://github.com/clundie/fwink/) where more people
will find it.

Download the installer from [lundie.ca](https://www.lundie.ca/fwink/).
