<h1>Compiling the Fwink Source Code</h1>

<p>To compile Fwink, you will need the following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>MS Visual C++ 6.0</li>
<li>Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 5</li>
<li>MS Platform SDK February 2003 or later</li>
<li>DirectX 9.0 SDK (summer 2003 update) including C++ sample source code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Crossbar</h2>

<p>You will need to copy <b>crossbar.cpp</b> and <b>crossbar.h</b> from the
DirectX 9 SDK into the Fwink folder. If you installed the SDK
to <b>C:\DX90SDK</b>, you will find these files in
<b>C:\DX90SDK\Samples\C++\DirectShow\Capture\amcap</b>.</p>

<h2>DirectShow Base Classes</h2>

<p>You also need to build the <b>Base Classes</b> DirectShow sample. The
project is located at <b>C:\DX90SDK\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses</b>.
Open the file <b>baseclasses.dsw</b>.
Build the UNICODE release and debug versions of the project.
It should create the libraries <b>strmbase.lib</b> and <b>strmbasd.lib</b> which Fwink needs to link to.</p>

<h2>MS Layer For Unicode</h2>

<p>The MS Layer for Unicode lets Unicode applications run on Windows 95, 98 and ME.
Fwink will link with <b>unicows.lib</b> which replaces some of the Win32 Unicode
functions. On Windows 95, 98 and ME, the unicows.dll library implements these
functions. Windows NT, 2000 and XP will use their native system calls.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> The February 2003 Platform SDK has a bug in unicows.lib that
prevents the debug version of Fwink from linking in VC++ 6.0.
This should be fixed with the next release of the Platform SDK.
This issue should not affect Visual Studio .NET.</p>
