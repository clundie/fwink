<h1>Compiling the Fwink Source Code</h1>

<p>Fwink was compiled in the following environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Standard Edition</li>
<li>Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2</li>
<li>DirectX SDK April 2006</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that is all you need. I do not
know if Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition can
load the solution &amp; project files.</p>

<h2>MS Layer For Unicode</h2>

<p>Fwink is a fully Unicode application.
It links with the Microsoft Layer for Unicode (MSLU)
in order to run on Windows 98 and ME.</p>
