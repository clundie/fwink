0.9.9.2:

* Added timeouts to FTP connection to prevent getting stuck.

JPEG processing. See Microsoft security bulletin
(http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/200409_jpeg.mspx).
Windows 98/ME/2000 users must update Fwink to fix this vulnerability.
Windows XP/2003 users must use Windows Update to fix this vulnerability,
and do not need to update Fwink.

* New feature: Overlay.


0.9.7.2:

* New feature: Disable timer.
* Source code updated for DirectX 9.0 SDK Summer 2003 Update (Number of

did not work properly with the keyboard.

0.9.6.0:

hard disk.
* New feature: Disable FTP. Now you can completely disable file uploads.
This is useful if you just want to save your images as files.
* Now, Fwink will not erase its settings when you uninstall it.
This makes it convenient to remove Fwink and keep your settings
when you install a newer version.
* Bug fix: The installer will now put the shortcuts in the correct
Start Menu folder. Previously, it always used the "Programs" folder,
which is correct only for English language users.

* New feature: Separate date and time.
You can turn off the date or time in the time stamp.
* New feature: Automated update checking.
When you click on the "Fwink Home Page" button,
it checks to see if a new version is available.
If so, you get a quick link to download it.
* New feature: Upload and Quit. If you supply the
command-line argument "oneshot", Fwink will take one picture
and then quit. The installer makes a shortcut that does this.


0.9.4.0:

* New feature: position the text message and time stamp. There are nine
positions to choose from.
